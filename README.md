📌 Project Overview

Mental health disorders have become a significant global health concern, imposing substantial social and economic burdens. This project conducts a comprehensive data-driven analysis of global mental health trends from 1990 to 2019, specifically focusing on the interactions between Anxiety Disorders, Eating Disorders, and Bipolar Disorder. By utilizing Prevalence and DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) datasets, this research explores how these disorders correlate and predicts their future trajectories using linear regression models.
